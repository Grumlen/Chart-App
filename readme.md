#Charts App
##Description

Charts App was built using requireJS and chartJS. It allows the user to modify a table by editing values, column names, row names, and adding/removing columns and rows. Beneath the table a chart will be rendered that represents the data entered. A user can choose between a bar, line, or radar graph. The information in the table is stored in localStorage under the key 'myChart'.
